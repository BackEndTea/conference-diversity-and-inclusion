## 1. Definitions

#### 1.1 Diversity
Diversity represents the full spectrum of human demographic differences -- race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, socio-economic status or physical disability. 
A lot of companies consider lifestyles, personality characteristics, perspectives, opinions, family composition, education level or tenure elements of diversity, too.

As a starting point to assess diversity, you need to quantify the various constituencies -- demographic, social and otherwise.

#### 1.2 Inclusion
Inclusion has to be understood as very different from diversity because simply having a wide roster of demographic characteristics won't make a difference to an organization's bottom line unless the people who fall into any one demographic feel welcomed.

Inclusion refers to a cultural and environmental feeling of belonging.

It can be assessed as the extent to which people are valued, respected, accepted and encouraged to fully participate in the organization.
