# Diversity and Inclusion Guidelines for Conferences


## *_"Diversity Doesn't Stick Without Inclusion”_*


## 1. Definitions

#### 1.1 Diversity
Diversity represents the full spectrum of human demographic differences -- race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, socio-economic status or physical disability. 
A lot of companies consider lifestyles, personality characteristics, perspectives, opinions, family composition, education level or tenure elements of diversity, too.

As a starting point to assess diversity, you need to quantify the various constituencies -- demographic, social and otherwise.

#### 1.2 Inclusion
Inclusion has to be understood as very different from diversity because simply having a wide roster of demographic characteristics won't make a difference to an organization's bottom line unless the people who fall into any one demographic feel welcomed.

Inclusion refers to a cultural and environmental feeling of belonging.

It can be assessed as the extent to which people are valued, respected, accepted and encouraged to fully participate in the organization.



## 2. Why

Diversity Doesn't Stick Without Inclusion. As the Harvard Business Review article put it: "In the context of the workplace, diversity equals representation. Without inclusion, however, the crucial connections that attract diverse talent, encourage their participation, foster innovation, and lead to business growth won't happen." 

So, it's true that diversity and inclusion work together to affect outcomes.

But understanding them as fundamentally different things is essential, because it bifurcates and clarifies the primary challenge for leaders: understanding the implication that demographic variety has on business performance, and creating an environment that invites the full spectrum of employee perspectives and maximizes them.

#### 2.1 Combat unconscious bias
Unconscious biases are shortcuts our brains take in processing information. We are all guilty of bias. 

#### 2.2 (Un)safe environment
We can’t expect underrepresented individuals to show up when their daily lives are filled with harassment, fear and unequal treatment. Simply opening up an opportunity to broader public doesn’t constitute an inclusion strategy.

#### 2.3 Going beyond gender
Often, diversity efforts are focused solely on gender (concentrating on including white women, to be specific). While it’s reasonable to start somewhere, diversity and inclusion are nowhere near one dimensional.

#### 2.4 Not intentional, still harmful
Having used sexist language does not mean that the person who used it had sexist intent. However, continuing to include sexist language, and fighting against a change away from sexist language, has sexist effects regardless of intent.
Lots of communication habits are deeply ingrained: changing the way you write or speak does sometimes take extra effort. With practice, it does get easier.

#### 2.5 Audience
Knowing your audience is critical to ensuring that meeting room layouts, menus, and other elements of the event will allow every participant to engage fully. Make sure your registration materials and forms ask specifically about your audience's needs and accommodations. 


## 3. Language

#### Choosing words with dignity
What you write and what you say can enhance the dignity of people with disabilities and promote positive attitudes about their abilities. This [pdf](http://www.adahospitality.org/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/Choosing%20Words%20with%20Dignity.pdf) includes examples of Affirmative Phrases (Do use) and Negative Phrases (Don't use)

#### Avoid gendered pronouns
Avoid using male pronouns ("he", "him", "his") in circumstances that describe people of any gender.  Find examples of nonsexist language [here](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Nonsexist_language) 

#### Avoid gendered terms
For example, avoid these words when addressing groups: Guys, Ladies & Gentlemen. Instead use: Folks, Everybody, People. More examples [here](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Nonsexist_language).
